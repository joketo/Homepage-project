	        <p>I like to design and make clothes. Dresses are my speciality.</p>
	        <p>All fabric in my clothes is bought from a shop. The only exception is the skirt with maple leaves, which I printed myself. I plan to design more of my own patterns in the future. </p>
	        <p> RIGHT NOW this section is wating for the big photoshoot I'm going to arrange later this spring of all my clothes. I want to present them nicely, so unfortunately there's no pictures of clothes available before that. </br>Instead, please enjoy this picture of the sheep pillows i designed and made.</p>
