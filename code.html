	            <h3>Software Engineering project - Oona</h3>	        	        
	            <p>The software engineering project is a big project course comparable to an internship. It was by far the most useful school project I've done. I learned how to deal with the customer, how to make good documentation, how to use Laravel, php, html and Javascript and most of all, how to work in a team. You can see our team's repository <a href="https://github.com/OhtuSamurai/drunken-octo-hipster">here</a>.

	            <h3>Heap comparison program</h3>
	            <p>This is a program to demonstrate the differences between different kinds of heaps. I programmed Fibonacci-, Binary-, and Binomi heaps. After that I tested on each heap how long it takes to insert, delete or take the min-value of them. These were tested on different values. The whole thing is made with Java. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/joketo/tiralabra">Github</a>.

	            <h3>A tool for assigning shifts for home care workers</h3>
	            <p>A program I made with a pair as a database project. In home care there is x workers and y customers with 1 to 5 daily visits each. Our tool divides all the customers between the workers so that the workload per workers is as equal as possible. Some visits have special requirements for the worker which needs to be taken account. In this project, we used Python. For Finnish documentation and other details, see <a href="https://github.com/joketo/Vuorolistajarjestelma">Github</a>.
