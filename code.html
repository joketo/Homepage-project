	        <h3>Software Engineering project - Oona</h3>
	        	        
	        <p>The software engineering project is a big project comparable to an internship. It was by far the most useful school project I've done. I learned how to deal with the customer, how to make good documentation, how to use Laravel, php, html and Javascript and most of all, how to work in a team. You can see our team's repository <a href="https://github.com/OhtuSamurai/drunken-octo-hipster">here</a>.</p>

	        <h3>Heap comparison -program</h3>

	        <p>This is a program to demonstrate the differences between different kinds of heaps. I programmed Fibonacci-, Binary-, and Binomi heaps. After that I tested on each heap how long it takes to insert, delete or take the min-value of them. These were tested on different values. The whole thing is made with Java. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/joketo/tiralabra">Github</a>.</p>
