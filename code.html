	            <h3>Software Engineering project - Oona</h3>	        	        
	            <p>The software engineering project is a big project course comparable to an internship, and by far the most useful school project I've completed. I learned how to deal with a customer, how to make good documentation, how to use Laravel, php, html and Javascript and most of all, how to work in a team. You can see our team's repository <a href="https://github.com/OhtuSamurai/drunken-octo-hipster">here</a>.

	            <h3>Heap comparison program</h3>
	            <p>This is a program to demonstrate the differences between different kinds of heaps. I implemented the Fibonacci, Binary, and Binomial heaps in Java and tested how long it takes to insert, delete or take the min value in them. These were tested with different values. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/joketo/tiralabra">Github</a>.

	            <h3>A tool for assigning shifts for home care workers</h3>
	            <p>A program I made with a pair as a database project. In home care there are a number of workers and customers which need to be visited 1 to 5 times each day. Our tool divides all the customers between the workers so that the workload per worker is as equal as possible. Some visits have special requirements for the worker which needs to be taken account. In this project, we used Python. For Finnish documentation and other details, see <a href="https://github.com/joketo/Vuorolistajarjestelma">Github</a>.

	            <h3>A small web-software made in Sortware Engineering course</h3>
	            <p>A group project where we learned the basics of agile software development. We made a small program, but the main idea was to follow the principles of the agile software development throughout the project. I was the scrum master in this project. <a href="https://github.com/joketo/mini-mini-ohtu">Here</a> is the software we made.</p>
