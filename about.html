            <p>
            At the end of highschool I got interested in programming. When I needed to decide what I wanted to study, I chose Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. At that time I didn't really know what it was all about and spent the first year mostly being very confused. Everyone seemed to be so good already and I was just getting started - was this really something I could do?

            After three years I decided it was time to try something else and started studies to be a craft teacher. Something so completely different actually created a nice balance to the theory-heavy CS-studies. The study program was great and I especially enjoyed the sewing and design classes.</p>
            <p>After a while I found myself missing programming and all the challenge, because that's what computer science for me is all about. I decided to give it one last try and started completing my bachelor's degree. Something had clicked and everything seemed much more interesting and compelling all of the sudden. Thanks to my new attitude I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2016.

            <p> I'm now working on my master's thesis about usability. There is still much I want and need to learn! But as the title of my <a href="code.html">Code-page</a> says, I've taken the first steps.
            </p>
            <p>As a side project of my life I love to make clothes. Photos of some of those can be found <a href="clothes.html">here</a>.</p>
