            <p>Everyone has art portfolios, but why are there programming projects in mine? </p>
            <p>
            At the end of highschool I got interested in programming. When I needed to decide what I wanted to study, I chose Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. At that time I didn't really know what it was all about and spent the first year mostly being very confused. Everyone seemed to be so good already and I was just getting started - was this really something I could do?
            </p>

            After three years I decided it was time to try something else and started studies to be a craft teacher. It was something so compeletly different that I thought it would balance out the theory-heavy CS-studies. For a while (a month, really) I felt that teaching was definately my field. Nonetheless, I soon found myself missing programming and all the challenge, because that's what computer science for me is all about. I decided to give it one last try and started completing my bachelor's degree. Something had clicked and everything seemed much more interesting and compelling all of the sudden.
            </p>
            <p> I'm now finishing my last mathematics course required for my bachelor's degree. There is still much I want to learn! But as the title of my <a href="code.html">Code-page</a> says, I've taken the first steps.
